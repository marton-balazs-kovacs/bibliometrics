# Introduction

-   Uses of the method:

    -   gain a one-stop overview

    -   identify knowledge gaps

    -   identify key players such as researchers, institutions, countries, or journals and make visible the scope and impact of the work of these players

    -   derive novel ideas for investigation

    -   position their intended contributions to the field

    -   aiding academic evaluation

-   various levels of granularity

    -   single researcher

    -   department/institution

    -   entire field or discipline

-   distinction from other methods for evidence synthesis

    -   Meta-analysis, systematic review, and bibliometrics
    -   See Donthu et al. (2021) Table 1.

-   Techniques

    -   The specific metrics and indicators used in a bibliometric analysis will depend on the particular research question and the type of data being analysed

    -   Two main categories: performance analysis and science mapping

    -   Performance analysis

        -   Descriptive

        -   A lot of possible measures of performance exists

            -   Citation: measure of impact and influence

            -   Publication: measure of productivity

                -   journal articles, conference proceedings papers, book chapters, preprints

            -   Joined measures, such as h-index

    -   Science mapping

        -   Map the intellectual and bibliometric structure of a field

        -   Methods

            -   Citation analysis

            -   Bibliographic coupling

            -   Co-word analysis

            -   Coauthorship analysis

        -   It can be combined with network analysis

        -   Citation analysis

            -   Assumption: citation is an intellectual link between two works

            -   Number of citations used to measure the influence of the paper

# Glossary

-   **performance analysis:** accounts for the contributions of research constituents to a given field

-   **science mapping:** focuses on the relationships between research constituents research constituents: e.g., authors, institutions, countries, and journals

-   **bibliographic data:** article and journal titles, abstracts, author names, publication dates, as well as cited references and citing documents of journal articles, conference papers, and other published works

-   **citation:** formal references from one publication to another.
    They represent knowledge flow between publications.

# OpenAlex

-   The [**OpenAlex**](https://openalex.org/)(OA) online platform enables searching the database without the use of an API

-   Open-source database that does not require a subscription

## The dataset

-   OA harvests scholarly data from multiple different sources including scholarly registries and other scholarly databases, repositories and archives, and webcrawles.
    [See the full list of sources.](https://help.openalex.org/hc/en-us/articles/24397285563671-About-the-data)

-   Then OA disambiguate the data and creates connections between the harvested scholarly entities.

-   Scholarly entities in OA are *Works, Authors, Sources, Institutions, Topics, Publishers, and Funders*

-   One can search any of these entities separately or the connection between them and create quick reports on the OA platform or use bibliometric analysis methods to get a deeper insight into the scholarly data

-   

## Searching

-   Stemming is applied by default.

    -   When you search *"surgery"* you will get results containing *"surgeries"* as well.

-   If you want **to disable stemming** and search for an exact phrase **use "" marks**.

-   You can use **AND** and **OR** in the search to create intricate search strategies.

-   **Use () to define the order** in which the search terms should be applied.

-   You can define multiple search filters

    -   e.g. excluding retracted papers from your search, searching for papers published by a given institution

    -   To do this click on the **"+"** icon on the OA website

        -   Click on **"... More"** to see all the available search filters.
